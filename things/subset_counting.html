        <h2>Subset counting trick</h2>
        <p>
            Suppose we have two graphs \(H\) and \(G\), where we have that
            \(v(H) = k\) and \(v(G) = n\) (with a very large \(n\)).
        </p>

        <p>
            Suppose further that every \(m\)-set of \(G\) has a copy of \(H\).
            How many copies of \(H\) do we have in total?
        </p>

        <p>
            We may get a very easy lowerbound by double counting. Notice that
            every copy of \(H\) is in exactly \[\binom{n-k}{m-k}\] \(m\)-sets of
            \(G\).
        </p>

        <p>
            As we have \(\binom{n}{m}\) \(m\)-sets, this means we must have at
            least:
        </p>
        \[\binom{n}{m} / \binom{n-k}{m-k}\]

        <p>copies of \(H\). ;)</p>
